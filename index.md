## Career

I have been actively involved in various extracurricular activities since high school. From being part of the high school soccer team to taking part in hacking competitions, I always look to take on a challenge and venture new areas.  Working with cohesive systems interface in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences under Dr. Sushil Kumar Meher sparked my interest in computer science and mathematical modelling. In college, I continue to foster my passion for programming by being an active member of ACM where I participate in various programming workshops and events alongside other like-minded individuals. I hope to expand my skill sets in the coming years through more internships and projects!

## Hobbies

In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer and chilling out in the beach. I also like to go hiking. ```Some of my favorite hikes were in Sedona and Yosemite. ```
